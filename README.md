# Artin Mohsenpour

`Software Deveoper | Frontend Web Developer | IT Research & Data Analysis Specialist`

I'm a front-end web developer and recently learning some backend technologies such as C# and ASP .Net. At OWL University of Applied Sciences and Arts, our team is pushing the boundaries of IT research, where I contribute to programming, data analysis, and collaborative projects. My education in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering informs my approach, as I work towards completing my master's degree in June 2024. Parallel to academia, I apply my specialized skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js to create dynamic web solutions as a Web Developer. My portfolio ranges from an e-commerce site to a sophisticated banknote authentication system, showcasing a keen ability to translate complex problems into user-friendly applications.
